# Participant Management Implementation Summary

## âœ… Completed Features

### 1. Database Models
- **Updated Trial Model** (`models/Trial.js`):
  - Added `randomizationRatio` field (array of numbers, default [1,1])
  - Added `targetEnrollment` field (number, default 100)
  - Updated status enum to include "paused"

- **New Participant Model** (`models/Participant.js`):
  - `participantCode`: Unique identifier for blinding
  - `trialId`: Reference to parent trial
  - `status`: Enrollment status (enrolled, active, completed, withdrawn)
  - `assignedGroup`: Treatment arm assignment (kept private for blinding)
  - `enrollmentDate`: Auto-generated timestamp
  - `isUnblinded`: Boolean flag for future unblinding functionality

### 2. API Routes

#### `/api/trials/[trialId]/participants` (GET)
- Fetches all participants for a trial
- **CRUCIAL**: Omits `assignedGroup` field to maintain blind
- Sorts by enrollment date (newest first)
- Returns participant code, status, enrollment date only

#### `/api/trials/[trialId]/participants` (POST)
- Enrolls new participants with automatic randomization
- Generates unique participant codes (format: P{timestamp}{random})
- Validates trial status (must be "active")
- Checks enrollment capacity against target
- Performs weighted randomization based on trial's randomization ratio
- Returns participant data without assignment group

#### `/api/trials/[trialId]/status` (PUT)
- Updates trial status for enrollment control
- Supports: draft, active, paused, completed
- Used by pause/resume enrollment functionality

#### `/api/trials/[trialId]` (GET)
- Fetches individual trial details
- Required for the trial detail page

### 3. Frontend Components

#### Trial Detail Page (`/dashboard/trials/[trialId]`)
- **Enrollment Controls**:
  - Pause/Resume Enrollment buttons
  - Enroll New Participant button
  - Complete Trial button
  - Status-based button states and validation

- **Participant Dashboard**:
  - Blinded participant table (no treatment groups shown)
  - Real-time enrollment statistics (X/Y enrolled)
  - Participant codes, enrollment dates, and status
  - Auto-refresh after new enrollments

- **High-Level Stats**:
  - Current enrollment vs target display
  - Visual status indicators with color coding
  - Trial status management

#### Updated Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
- Enhanced trial cards with enrollment stats
- "View Details" buttons linking to trial detail pages
- Improved visual design and status indicators

#### Enhanced Trial Creation (`/dashboard/trials/new`)
- Added "Randomization" step to wizard
- Target enrollment input field
- Randomization ratio configuration per arm
- Dynamic ratio adjustment when arms are added/removed
- Updated status options including "paused"

## ðŸ”’ Blinding Implementation

### Server-Side Blinding
- API responses explicitly exclude `assignedGroup` field
- Mongoose `.select()` used to omit sensitive fields
- Randomization logic isolated to enrollment endpoint

### Frontend Blinding
- No treatment group information displayed in UI
- Participant table shows only safe identifiers
- Admin cannot see treatment assignments through interface

## ðŸŽ² Randomization Logic

### Weighted Randomization
- Supports custom ratios per arm (e.g., 2:1, 1:1:1)
- Uses cumulative weight distribution
- Cryptographically secure random number generation
- Maintains ratio accuracy over large enrollments

### Enrollment Validation
- Trial must be in "active" status
- Cannot exceed target enrollment
- Unique participant code generation with retry logic
- Automatic status management

## ðŸ§ª Testing

### Test Script (`scripts/testParticipantEnrollment.js`)
- Automated testing of randomization distribution
- Blinding validation
- Database operation verification
- Clean test data management

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria Met

âœ… **Admin can navigate to specific trial detail pages**
- Dynamic routing implemented (`/dashboard/trials/[trialId]`)
- Navigation from dashboard with "View Details" buttons

âœ… **Enroll participants with instant UI updates**
- "Enroll New Participant" button triggers API call
- Automatic participant list refresh after enrollment
- Real-time enrollment statistics

âœ… **Blinded participant display**
- Participant table shows coded IDs only
- Treatment group information completely hidden
- Server-side enforcement of blinding

âœ… **Pause/Resume enrollment controls**
- Status update API integration
- Real-time trial status management
- Button states reflect current status

## ðŸš€ Usage Instructions

1. **Create a Trial**: Use the enhanced wizard to set up arms, ratios, and target enrollment
2. **Activate Trial**: Set status to "active" to enable enrollment
3. **Navigate to Trial**: Click "View Details" from dashboard
4. **Enroll Participants**: Use "Enroll New Participant" button
5. **Monitor Progress**: View enrollment stats and participant list
6. **Control Enrollment**: Use pause/resume buttons as needed

## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture

- **Next.js 14** with App Router
- **MongoDB** with Mongoose ODM
- **NextAuth** for authentication
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Client-side state management** with React hooks
- **RESTful API design** with proper HTTP methods
- **Responsive design** for various screen sizes

The implementation provides a robust, production-ready participant management system with proper blinding, randomization, and administrative controls.
