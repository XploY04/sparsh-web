# Data Export and Analytics Features - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of the final stage of the Next.js clinical trials prototype, focusing on data export capabilities and enhanced analytics dashboard.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Data Export API (`/api/trials/[trialId]/export`)

**Location**: `app/api/trials/[trialId]/export/route.js`

**Functionality**:

- Accepts query parameter `?blinded=true/false` to control data visibility
- Exports comprehensive trial data including:
  - Participant information (code, enrollment date, status, group assignment)
  - All data points with timestamps, types, severity, and payloads
  - Proper CSV formatting with headers
- **Security**: Prevents unblinded data export if trial is still blinded
- **File handling**: Automatically generates descriptive filenames with trial name and date
- **Headers**: Sets proper Content-Type and Content-Disposition for browser downloads

**Sample CSV Structure**:

```csv
participantCode,enrollmentDate,status,assignedGroup,dataType,timestamp,severity,isAlert,payload
P001,2024-01-15,active,Group 1,SymptomReport,2024-01-16T10:30:00Z,medium,No,"{\"symptoms\":[\"headache\"]}"
```

### 2. Enhanced Reports Dashboard

**Location**: `app/dashboard/trials/[trialId]/reports/page.js`

**New Features**:

- **Export Buttons**: Interactive download buttons with loading states and error handling
- **Enrollment Over Time Chart**: Line chart showing daily and cumulative enrollment
- **Enhanced Metrics**: 5-card dashboard with enrollment progress visualization
- **Progress Bars**: Visual enrollment progress indicators
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly grid layout

**Charts Included**:

1. **Enrollment Over Time** - Shows recruitment progress
2. **Data Types Distribution** - Bar chart of data categories
3. **Severity Distribution** - Pie chart of alert severities
4. **Daily Activity** - Time series of data collection
5. **Alert Types** - Analysis of alert patterns

### 3. Reusable Components

**Export Button Component** (`app/dashboard/components/ExportButton.js`):

- Handles download states (downloading, error, success)
- Provides user feedback with loading spinners
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Disabled state handling for unblinded exports

**Metric Card Component** (`app/dashboard/components/MetricCard.js`):

- Consistent styling for dashboard metrics
- Icon support and color coding
- Hover effects and responsive design

**Progress Bar Component** (`app/dashboard/components/ProgressBar.js`):

- Visual progress indicators
- Percentage calculations
- Color-coded progress states

### 4. Enhanced Aggregated Data API

**Location**: `app/api/trials/[trialId]/aggregated-data/route.js`

**New Data**:

- **Enrollment Over Time**: Daily and cumulative enrollment metrics
- **Enhanced Calculations**: Progress percentages and completion rates

## Security & Compliance

### Blinding Protection

- Export API validates trial blinding status before serving unblinded data
- UI clearly indicates when unblinded features are disabled
- Audit trail integration for all export activities

### Error Handling

- Comprehensive error messages for API failures
- User-friendly feedback for network issues
- Graceful degradation when data is unavailable

## User Experience Improvements

### Dashboard Enhancements

- **Quick Access**: Direct "Reports" button on main dashboard
- **Status Indicators**: Visual badges for trial status and blinding state
- **Metrics Overview**: At-a-glance trial statistics

### Navigation

- Breadcrumb navigation between dashboard sections
- Quick action buttons for common tasks
- Responsive design for mobile access

## Technical Implementation Details

### Dependencies Added

- `json2csv`: For CSV generation and formatting
- Enhanced Recharts integration for new chart types

### Database Queries

- Optimized aggregation pipelines for enrollment data
- Efficient participant and data point queries with proper indexing
- Population of related documents for comprehensive exports

### File Handling

- Proper MIME types for CSV downloads
- Dynamic filename generation with sanitization
- Browser-compatible download mechanisms

## Success Criteria Achieved ✅

1. **✅ Blinded CSV Export**: Admin can download blinded trial data
2. **✅ Unblinded CSV Export**: Available after trial unblinding with proper controls
3. **✅ Enhanced Analytics**: Dashboard includes 4+ clear, useful charts
4. **✅ Cohesive Prototype**: Functional demonstration of all core features

## Usage Instructions

### Exporting Data

1. Navigate to trial reports page
2. Click "Export Blinded Data" for anonymized data
3. After unblinding, "Export Unblinded Data" becomes available
4. Files download automatically with descriptive names

### Viewing Analytics

1. Access reports from trial detail page or main dashboard
2. View enrollment progress, data distribution, and alert patterns
3. Use interactive charts for detailed analysis

## Future Enhancements

- **Data Filtering**: Export specific date ranges or data types
- **Multiple Formats**: Support for Excel, JSON exports
- **Scheduled Exports**: Automated report generation
- **Advanced Analytics**: Statistical analysis and trend detection
